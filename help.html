    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>MEMS-Scan is a software utility intended for diagnostics and testing of the Rover Modular Engine Management System (MEMS). Currently, it supports only MEMS 1.6, which is characterized by a round three-pin diagnostic plug typically found in the engine compartment near the firewall.</p>
    <p><b>MEMS-Scan is built on the work of Colins MEMSgauge and Leopolds MEMS-rosco. Communication is based on the librosco library, but has been specifically adapted to MEMS-Scan. I would like to thank Colin, Leopold, Alan, Andy and Martin for their contributions and feedback. Haro</p>
    <!-- <p>logged files, stored under /logs, may be viewed by Al Richey's mems analyser (http://www.rmrsoft.com/mems/). -->
    <p>Not all vehicles fitted with MEMS 1.3, 1.6, 1.9 use the same set of sensors and actuators. MEMS-Scan was tested using a Mini SPi 1.3, some features supported by the software are not used on that car. If you would like to contribute and have a MEMS 1.6 engine with either a turbo fitted, an automatic gearbox, A/C or other features that are not on the Mini SPi engine, please contact me.</p>
    <h3>Interface cable</h3>
    <p>To communicate with the MEMS ECU, MEMS-Scan requires a special interface cable. Information on building a cable can be found <a href="https://github.com/colinbourassa/librosco/blob/wiki/HardwareInterface.md">here</a>.</p>
    <p>To summarize: the cable must be based on a USB 5V (TTL) serial converter. The FTDI TTL-232R-5V is recommended. The required connector shell is the TE Connectivity 172201. The shell must be populated with three pins, which are TE Connectivity 170280.</p>
    <p>Looking at the face of the connector with the key (notch) on the bottom, pin 1 will be on the top. Pin numbering continues clockwise. Pin 1 must be connected to the FTDI cable's GND (black) wire. Pin 2 is connected to the FTDI RxD (yellow), and pin 3 is connected to FTDI TxD (orange). The other FTDI wires are not used, and should be cut back and insulated.</p>

	<h3>Features</h3>
    <p><b>Settings:</b> The temperature and manifold pressure gauges can be switched to different units by selecting "Edit settings" from the "Options" menu.</p>
    <p><b>ECU ID:</b> Displays, in hexadecimal, the response from the ECU to the command 0xD0, which is sent during the initialization of the serial link. If you have any information about the meaning of this four-byte response, please send the information to the author.</p>
    <p><b>Communications:</b> Status indicators; green when the serial link is good, red when bad.
	<p><b>ECU Errors:</b> Red indicator if errors are present in the ECU.
	<p><b>Overview:</b> Most important parameters are shown in this tab. Also possible to start and stop logging.
	<p><b>Adjustments:</b> Several settings of the ECU can be adjusted manually or a complete reset of the ECU can be executed. Before adjustments are made it is strongly recommended to record the current settings, so that it is alway possble to go back to the initial settings. Automatic resetting of all adjustments to factory settings is not (yet) possible.
	<p><b>Errors:</b> A total of 24 possible errors are shown that are recorded by the ECU. Not all errors are known, but all can by cleared. Also a green indicator will light up if there is a signal from the RPM/TDC sensor. Lastly there are some indicators for anomalies. These anomalies are NOT recorded by the ECU, but MEMS-Scan considers values out of the ordinary. Therefore they are only visible/recorded when MEMS-Scan is connected and remain only untill disconnected.
	<p><b>Actuators:</b> For the safety of the engine, the actuator tests are only available when the engine is not running. Note that not all cars are fitted with all the actuators for which test functions are provided.</p>
    <p><b>All data:</b> All data is shown received from the ECU in reponse of both 0x7D and 0x80 commands. If known a description is given for the parameter and if applicable the response is interprated too.</p>
	<p></p>
	<p><b><i>Note:</b><i> Testing showed that the final position of the Idle Air Control Motor is sometimes not exactly the same as the commanded position. If difference is more than 1% it is advisable to select a higher Latency Timer in the advanced settings for the used COM port</i></p>
